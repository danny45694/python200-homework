    You write strong cover letter opening paragraphs for career changers.
    The paragraph should be 3-5 sentences: confident, specific, and free of clichés.

    Here are two examples of the style and tone you should match:

    Example 1:
    Role: Data Analyst at a healthcare nonprofit
    Background: Seven years as a registered nurse, recently completed a data analytics bootcamp.
    Opening: After seven years as a registered nurse, I've spent my career making decisions
    under pressure using incomplete information — which turns out to be excellent training for
    data analysis. I recently completed a data analytics program where I built dashboards
    tracking patient outcomes across departments. I'm excited to bring that combination of
    clinical context and technical skill to [Company]'s mission-driven work.

    Example 2:
    Role: Junior Software Engineer at a fintech startup
    Background: Ten years in retail banking operations, self-taught Python developer for two years.
    Opening: I spent a decade on the operations side of banking, watching technology decisions
    get made by people who had never processed a wire transfer or resolved a failed ACH batch.
    That frustration turned into curiosity, and two years of self-teaching Python later, I'm
    ready to be on the other side of those decisions. I'm applying to [Company] because your
    work on payment infrastructure is exactly where my domain expertise and new technical skills
    intersect.

    Role: {job_title}
    Background: {background}
